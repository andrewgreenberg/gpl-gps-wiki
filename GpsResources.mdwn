# Free and Open Source GPS Receiver Software Resources

Here's collection of resources for this site and links to others.

## ARM &amp; GNU ARM Tools

- [GNU ARM](http://www.gnuarm.com/): Prebuilt GNU ARM binaries. Highly recommended! GCC 3.4.3 and 4.1.
- [CodeSourcery GNU ARM Tools](http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/index_html) Prebuilt GNU ARM binaries - supported by ARM, which might be a nice thing. GCC 3.44.

## Articles and Books:

_[[Open Source Software for Commercial Off-the-Shelf GPS Receivers|/GpsResources/oss_for_cots_gps_receivers.pdf]]_ by Andrew Greenberg. My masters thesis! Perhaps not the best reading, sorry. But it is a decent introduction to GPS and the GPL-GPS project, I'll give it that.

_Global Positioning System: Theory and Applications Complete Set,_ J. Spilker &amp; B. Parkinson, Eds., AIAA, 1996. A must have if you're doing serious GPS work. Describes the ICDs, and expands on why things are the way they are.

_[Embedded Software Development with eCos](http://www.informit.com/content/downloads/perens/0130354732.pdf)_ by Anthony J. Massa. Prentice Hall, 2003. The only book on eCos available; it's a decent but incomplete introduction to the RTOS: once you're done with this book, you can then use the online reference documentation can be used from there. A free PDF of the book can be found at the above link.

_Fundamentals of Global Position System Receivers: A Software Approach (second edition)_ by James Bao-Yen Tsui. Wiley Series in Microwave and Optical Engeineering, 2000. A must-have for software receiver folks - the second edition corrects some of the buggy Matlab files and has nice info on weak signals. It's an excellent reference to have.

_The Global Positioning System &amp; Inertial Navigation_ by Jay A. Farrell and Matthew Barth. [[McGraw]] Hill, 1999. A great overview book on GPS, INS, and their integration. With examples.

_Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS_ by Gilbert Strang and Kai Borre. Wellesley-Cambridge Press, 1997. An excellent book for those who need an introduction - or in my case, a re-introduction - to linear algebra. Great stuff, good Matlab files. You can find the matlab files here: <http://kom.aau.dk/~borre/matlab/>

_Spatial Error Analysis_ by David Hsu. IEEE Press, 1999. The only book I could find that specifically treats spatial errors, a subject sorely missing from other GPS books. Includes lots of examples, Matlab code, and more kinds of error analysis than you can shake a stick at. Bonus: [[Here's the errata to the book, courtesy the author|/GpsResources/spacial_error_errata.pdf]].

_Understanding GPS Principles and Applications_ Editor: Elliott D. Kaplan. Artech House Publishers, 1996. A classic, and a great reference.

_Introduction to Random Signals and Applied Kalman Filtering_ by Robert Grover Brown and Patrick Y. C. Hwang. Jogn Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1997.
