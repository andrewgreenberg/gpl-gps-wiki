We're running a comparison of the MG5001 OEM software and GPL-GPS. We're going to get our butts kicked, since we have no fancy-pants features, but that's fine, I need this for my thesis _right now_. Defense this Friday, yikes! Here's a [[short run of data|GpsNotes/gpl-gps_log_1.txt]] from the log feature ('l' which runs the display\_log() function from position.c). Here's some [[ECEF data|GpsNotes/sigtec_log_2005-05-03-0.txt]] from the sigtec firmware.

Created this "notes" page. Less pretentious than "project log" ;). First fix of GPL-GPS! Here's a picture to prove it. Oh. Darn. Ignore the date, a bug in the clock bias correction (since fixed) caused the time to jump around, sometimes by years. Whoops.
