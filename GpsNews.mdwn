      <p> ION GNSS 2006 was held in Ft. Worth, TX this week. Doug Baker had his GPS Creations, LLC booth which hosted [[OpenSource]] GPS (OSGPS), the x86 PC w/GP2021 correlator project, and GPL-GPS. It was great fun - as always, we got to talk to hundreds of people and show off our projects. People were very interested this year... in fact, there was a big change this year: instead of people asking &#39;what&#39;s open source?&#39; they were asking &#39;what features do you have?&#39; which I think is a good sign. There were several open GNSS papers presented at ION GNSS, including one on the Linux port of OSGPS.<br>
        <br> I taught a class on GPL-GPS to six people down in Texas as one of GNSS Solution&#39;s nine seminars. The class went very well, and I think several of the people attending the class will actually start to use GPL-GPS.<br>
        <br> Cliff, Rick Niles, and I hung out and talked open souce GPS receiver projects for two days. Rick and Cliff have made a tremendous amount of progress in OSGPS: with the 2.0 release, I can say that their software really does come up to a commercial quality receiver. And OSGPS now has tons of features that GPL-GPS lacks: atmospheric corrections, carrier phase, better tracking loops, almanacs, etc. So we discussed trying to merge the OSGPS and GPL-GPS code bases as much as possible. I&#39;m going to look into this a bit - I think it&#39;s a good idea, except that there&#39;s a <strong>tremendous</strong> difference between a 1 GHz 64 bit Linux box and a MG5001. :) So we&#39;ll have to use tricks, including a partially separate code base for GPL-GPS and lots of &quot;#define embedded&quot; types of things.<br>
        <br> I am currently killing even more brain cells soldering up the carrier boards. Sorry for the delay, everyone who&#39;s waiting!<br>
        <br> I&#39;ve also begun work on a USB-only carrier board using the FTDI 2232 chip. More news soon. </p>
