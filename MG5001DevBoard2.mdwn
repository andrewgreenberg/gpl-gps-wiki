# Open Hardware MG5001/3 Development Board

Here's the latest version of the MG5001/MG5003 development board for GPL-GPS. Included in the zip file are the [CADSOFT EAGLE CAD](http://www.cadsoft.de/) files for the project, along with a parts list with Digikey part numbers, and the CAM files for manufacturing the board.

I'll post more details later, but suffice it to say this board is just better. Not only can hold the MG5003, but it's smaller, a bit more sane of a layout, and better labled. Here's the zip file:
