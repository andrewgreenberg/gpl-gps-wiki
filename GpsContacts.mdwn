Mea Culpa: This project was my Masters thesis in [[ECE at Portland State University](http://www.ece.pdx.edu) in Portland Oregon. Have any questions? Comments? Money? Time? You can reach me, Andrew Greenberg, at andrew(at)uad(dot)com or phone me at 503.788.1343. I'd love to hear from you!

Also, this project was directly inspired by it's end use: as a receiver and local differential station for the Launch Vehicle No. 2 (LV2) sounding rocket being developed by the [Portland State Aerospace Society](http://psas.pdx.edu) (PSAS).
