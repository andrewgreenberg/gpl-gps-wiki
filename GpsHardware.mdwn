## <a name="GPS Chipset"></a> GPS Chipset

GPL-GPS is currently only supports the [Zarlink](http://www.zarlink.com/) GP4020 GPS receiver chip, which is an [[ARM7TDMI]] 32 bit processor with an on-chip GPS correlator peripheral. The chip was previously owned by Mitel, and then previously owned before that by GEC Plessey.

- [GP4020](http://products.zarlink.com/product_profiles/GP4020.htm) home page
- [[Cheat sheet|GP4020CheatSheet]] for the GP4020 - Things That Aren't Obvious.
- [GP2015](http://products.zarlink.com/product_profiles/GP2015.htm) GPS RF front end, which takes the 1.575GHz signal, downconverts, and spits it out as a ~ 5MHz 2 bit digital signal.

What about other GPS chipsets? We're currently eyeing the Nemerix chipset since it has a embedded LEON (open source SPARC v8) processor, which already has eCos ported to it. We'll _eventually_ get to that, but first we'll finish polishing the GP4020 port which, uh, may take a while. heh.

We'd really love to do a version of GPL-GPS to other chipset manufacturers, like SiRF or Trimble. However, first these chipset manufacturers will need to release the documentation on their chips in some open way; e.g., release their datasheets to the web. Then we'd gladly port the GPL-GPS code. Unfortauntely, these chipsets now currently require a NDA and an ungodly expensive development kit if you want to use them. And then, of course, because of the NDA you can't share your work with others.

## <a name="GPS Receivers"></a> GPS Receivers

GPL-GPS software development is focussed on [SigTec Navigation's](http://www.signav.com.au/) MG5001 OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) GPS receiver. OEM means it's a circuit boad and nothing else: no keyboard, display, no antenna, etc. We chose the MG5001 because of it's nice layout, decent memory layout, and access to many of the GP4020's pins via a 51 pin connector.

GPL-GPS, however, should work on just about any Zarlink GP4020-based receiver. Some of these receivers are:

- [SigTec Navigation MG5001](http://www.signav.com.au/SignavDataFrame.html): Official GPL-GPS receiver. ([[Here are some notes on the MG5001 receiver|Mg5001]]).
- [SigTec Navigation MG5003](http://www.signav.com.au/SignavDataFrame.html): A smaller receiver (boots from serial EEPROM!), but no 51 pin connector.
- [Novatel (was CMC) SUPERSTAR II](http://www.novatel.com/Products/superstar.asp): A very nice GP4020-based board, but no 51 pin connector.

## <a name="Development boards"></a> Development boards

Usually you need more than just the GPS board - you need a "carrier" board with power supplies and RS-232C line converters, maybe even a USB to serial converter onboard. Here are our open hardware development, or carrier boards:

- [[SigNav MG5001/3 Development Board Rev. 2|MG5001DevBoard2]]: An improved open hardware development board.
- [[SigTec MG5001 Receiver Development Board|MG5001DevBoard]]: An open hardware development board/carrer for SigTec Navigation's MG5001 GPS recevier
- [[Parallel port to JTAG Interface|GpsJtag]]: A board to connect a PC's parallel port to the JTAG pins on the GP4020.
